# Spring Security and Angular

This repository contains code related to spring security with angular. Each new branch will have new feature or improved code as compared to previous branch. And branches should be merged to `main` branch using pull requests. Each pull request must be signed using GPG. The naming convention is the following:
`x-feature-name`
where `x` is a 2-digit number (can be of 3 digits in future, if required), starting from `00`.

Later we will add some github pipelins to validate code and run unit / functional tests to prevent buggy code from being pushed to `main` branch.
